## üß† Reflection

This project was developed as a side project for the Jump Digital School Bootcamp to better understand frontend development, particularly in working with external APIs like the OpenWeather.

The goal was to build a user-friendly application where users can easily check the current weather and forecast for the next few days.

The project posed a series of challenges including:

- Deep understanding of JavaScript
- Performing API calls
- Implementing custom animations based on weather conditions
- Implementing mobile first approach

These challenges were significant in deepening my understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how different parts of an application interact with each other.
